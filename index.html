            <p>
                You put the boom-boom into my heart
                You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
                Jitterbug into my brain
                Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same
                But something's bugging you
                Something ain't right
                My best friend told me what you did last night
                Left me sleepin' in my bed
                I was dreaming, but I should have been with you instead.
